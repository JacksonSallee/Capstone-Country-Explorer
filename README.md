# Capstone-Country-Explorer
This is my version of the capstone project from IBM SkillsBuild for the certificate "Front End Developer"

# Extensions

This project has been updated to call from the https://restcountries.com/ endpoint through my own backend demostrating the Model-View-Controller architecture of a full stack web application (my backend is hosted at https://capstone-country-explorer-backend.onrender.com/countries). The backend code is in this repository along with a repository strictly for the backend: https://github.com/JacksonSallee/Capstone-Country-Explorer-Backend

# Requirements

The application is intended for users to be able to explore facts about countries, such as their population, capital, region, and more. You need to quickly mockup a user interface (UI) and demonstrate the following functionality:

The list of countries is displayed using a card layout.

More countries can be added to the list using the Show More button at the bottom of the web page. 

Users can use filters to narrow down their search, based on three filters: country name, region, and population.

The cards displayed on the screen are dynamically updated, as the user changes the filter criteria.

Input validations are used to ensure that user inputs meet certain criteria.

Selecting a country card redirects the user to the Details page for that country, showing more information about it. 

Selecting the Back button on the Details page returns to the Main page of the application.
